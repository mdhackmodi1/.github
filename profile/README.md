This document provides an overview of the `Github Actions`, project structure, conventions, and how to contribute.

Creating a `GitHub Actions` workflow often involves writing multiple files and creating several repositories to specify the workflow in itself, as well as the actions, containers, and/or runners to use in the workflow. Depending on the number of users in your Enterprise Cloud or Enterprise Server instance, things can get messy pretty quickly if you don't have corporate standards in place for creating GitHub Actions workflows.

As a best practice, we recommend you document the following in a `GitHub wiki` or as a `markdown file` in a repository accessible to all within an organization:
- Repositories for storage
- Files/folders naming conventions
- Location of shared components
- Plans for ongoing maintenance
- Contribution guidelines

### Allowed Actions:
- Actions created by GitHub
- Actions by Marketplace verified creators

All other actions are not allowed

### Repositories for Storage:
- The project may consist of multiple repositories for better organization. (Specify the number and purpose of each repository here, e.g., one for core code, another for documentation).
- Each repository will be clearly named and versioned for easy reference.

### Files/Folders Naming Conventions:
- We follow a consistent naming convention for files and folders to improve readability and maintainability.
- (Specify the naming convention here, e.g., snake_case for filenames, descriptive folder names).

### Location of Shared Components:
- Shared components used across the project (e.g., configuration files, scripts) will be located in a dedicated directory.
- (Specify the directory location here, e.g., shared/).

### Plans for Ongoing Maintenance:
- We are committed to ongoing maintenance of this project.
- (Outline your plans for bug fixes, security updates, and feature enhancements here).

### Contribution Guidelines:
- We welcome contributions from the community!
- This document outlines the guidelines for contributing code, documentation, or other improvements.
- (Specify the contribution process here, including links to further details if needed, e.g., pull request workflow, coding style guide).

## We appreciate your interest in this project!
